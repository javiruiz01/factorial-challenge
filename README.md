# Factorial Challenge

## Description

> Your challenge is to build a Frontend + Backend application that allows you to post and visualize metrics in a usable way. Each metric will have a timestamp, name, and value. The metrics will be shown in a timeline and must show averages per minute/hour/day and persisted in the database.

For this purpose, I will be creating the following:

- A frontend application with
  - React
  - Vite
  - Tailwind
  - Recharts
- A backend application with dotnet
- An SQL Server database
